      <h3> Why not use fancy framework to make your website looks "better"?</h3>
      I like the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>. I am in the field of medical imaging, we often talk about signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The high SNR, the better. KISS principle is an idea to get high SNR, because the idea/content is the expected signal here instead of the design. Besides, I am not a professional front-end developer and don't want to waster too much time on the design. I will give you two articles influenced me on HTML design:<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html">Welcome to The HTML Hell Page</a> and <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">This is a Motherfucking Website</a>
